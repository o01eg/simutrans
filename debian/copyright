 Pau,
 .
 That is a little odd to claim it can't be modified. The whole point of
 making it free is so that developers can do anything they want with it.
 Somebody is adding more to what free means than what free means.
 .
 The code is totally free, with no restrictions on it whatsoever. There are no
 fees, no requirements to provide changes back to me, etc., and of course
 people can modify it. It would not be free if they couldn't. (And many people
 have. It's used in lots of projects, some free and some commercial.)
 .
 I inserted the "Freeware Public License" line to poke fun at the GNU Public
 License, which really is encumbered by silly restrictions. My code has
 absolutely no restrictions whatsoever.
 .
 You are hereby authorized to make any change you want to the license file or
 even adapt it as you see fit to address your own concerns.
 When I say it is free, I mean it really is free :-)
 .
 Paul

 The Artistic License
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
 reasonable modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
 .
     * "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
       Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
       created through textual modification.
     * "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
       modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
       of the Copyright Holder.
     * "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
       copyrights for the package.
     * "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
       this Package.
     * "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
       basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
       and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the
       Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
       as a market that must bear the fee.)
     * "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
       itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
       It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
       under the same conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
 modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
 that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
 when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
 following:
 .
     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
     site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
     your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
     organization.
 .
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
     to get the Standard Version.
 .
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
     the Package with your modifications.
 .
     c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
     Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
     non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
     pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get
     the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
 Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
 You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
 you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
 commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
 distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
 product of your own.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
 them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
 Package.
 .
 7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
 shall not be considered part of this Package.
 .
 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this software without specific prior written
 permission.
 .
 9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
