Subject: Link less libraries into makeobj

This fixes the following warnings from dpkg-shlibdeps:

  dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: dependency on libz.so.1 could be avoided if "debian/simutrans-makeobj/usr/games/makeobj" were not uselessly linked against it (they use none of its symbols).
  dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: dependency on libbz2.so.1.0 could be avoided if "debian/simutrans-makeobj/usr/games/makeobj" were not uselessly linked against it (they use none of its symbols).
